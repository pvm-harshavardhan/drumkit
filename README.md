# Drum-Kit

Developed a Music Drum Kit web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Allowing users to play drum sounds by pressing keys on both the on-screen interface and the keyboard.

Features eight keys corresponding to different drum sounds.

Each key produces a distinct sound upon activation based on the key pressed.
